    <h2>Video Games</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Passes time easy</li>

    <h2>My Cats</h2>
    <p>
      They are always fun to cuddle with and to just have something to look
      forward too after a day of school, Sherlock and Watson are their names.
      Sherlock is mean, but he is cuddly when he wants too, and Watson is super
      cuddly mostly unless your taking him to the vet then everything becomes chaotic.

    <h2>Sleeping</h2>

    <p>
      Sleeping is always great no matter the circumstances just being able to
      rest after doing something diffucult is always a good time. Even during
      the day taking a quick nap to revitalize yourself is always great. Not
      only that it also has a lot of benefits! Sleep can help with issues like:
      <li>Sickness</li>
      <li>Health problems</li>
      <li>Reducing stress</li>
      <li>Avoiding injuries</li>
      <li>Thinking clearly</li>
